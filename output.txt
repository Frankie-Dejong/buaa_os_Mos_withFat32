Lavender Haze

Taylor Swift

Meet me at midnight
Oooh oooh oooh woah
Oooh oooh oooh woah
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia
I been under scrutiny (yeah oh yeah)
You handle it beautifully (yeah oh yeah)
All this **** is new to me (yeah oh yeah)
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s **** they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
Oooh oooh oooh woah
Oooh oooh oooh woah
All they keep asking me (all they keep asking me)
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s **** they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
(Oooh Oooh Oooh Woah)
The lavender haze
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s **** they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
Oooh oooh oooh woah
Oooh oooh oooh woah
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
The lavender haze
I just wanna stay
I just wanna stay
In that lavender haze
